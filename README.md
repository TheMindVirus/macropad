Adafruit Macropad RP2040 with Transparent Lego Keycaps and Sounds from The Crystal Maze

# Introduction
The Macropad by Adafruit Industries is a Shortcut Keyboard powered by a Raspberry Pi RP2040. \
The same microcontroller powers the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 and the usage is much the same.

There are a wide range of CherryMX keyboard switches to choose from, each with different \
tactile feel and clickyness. How do you know which keys you like before buying a whole keyboard? \
This project will see you assembling your own Macropad with a selection of different CherryMX keys \
and keycaps to find what fits your preference and needs.

# Prototype
It is a good idea to prototype in any way you like before you receive the budget for your project. \
It's also useful for showing people what you want to create so that they know how to help you. \
I decided to create my prototype in Unity3D using Unity WebGL Player so it can run on a phone.

# Parts
To start with, I purchased a fine selection of Glorious CherryMX Switches from OverclockersUK. \
Every key switch in the sample pack is a different flavour of tactile feel and clickyness. \
You will need at least 12 of them to complete your Macropad.

To source the custom Lego pieces and also to create the original prototype, I turned to BrickLink Studio. \
The Studio 2.0 Software is much like Lego Digital Designer before it and allows you to freely make design choices. \
The prototype uses 2x2 Tiles whereas I ended up using 2x2 Bricks and 1x1 Tiles for the final build.

This wouldn't be a project about the Adafruit Macropad RP2040 without an Adafruit Macropad RP2040. \
I chose the one which doesn't come with any keys or backplate because I wanted to customise it and \
still be able to see the RP2040 that's powering the board on the underside.

Here is a close-up of the back of the printed circuit board (PCB). The central chip with the Raspberry \
logo is the RP2040 that runs your custom programs. Beside it is some flash memory and a ribbon cable \
for the display. A small speaker plays tones of a frequency you specify in either Arduino or CircuitPython.

The CherryMX keys are colour-coded to help identify their characteristics. The footprint of the Macropad \
allows you to choose between Cherry, Kailh and Gateron. Some switches are weighted differently from others \
and some emit a specific texture of sound when typed on repeatedly. There are also many more switch manufacturers.
