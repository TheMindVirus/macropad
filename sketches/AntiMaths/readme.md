# AntiMaths

The AntiMaths paradigm explores the idea of negative dimensions. \
It is a metaphysical concept whereby every bit of maths has equal and opposite antimaths.

Everything you do in the mathematical realm is mirrored in the xy plane instead of the x plane. \
It explores the idea of -0 x -0 being -0 instead of 0.

Normal Parabolic (and also Hyperbolic) Curves choose positive results for the negative dimension. \
Anti-Mathematical Shading and Controllerism prefers the use of tension curves instead.

This is done so that the transition between the negative side of x^2 and x^3 graphs \
doesn't have to flip up and down - the default interpolation of which is undefined for x^2.5.

It is suggested that the coefficient of -cos(2n) be used as the default interpolation. \
Otherwise, it forms a mirrored curve to make the value of n a real number instead of an integer.

With n being the number of dimensions, x is the input value and y is the output value. \
This also has implications for 3D because x and y (with z swapped and flipped) \
forms the same graph if not more complex with z and -z being factored in.

AntiMaths seeks to find a usable pattern within a suitably defined context.

The example used to generate the custom code was that of programmable shading \
and also 2D->3D Proto-board PCB design, whereby you have a number of pads in a grid \
of variable dimensions. (Sometimes the dimensions are the same and squares can be simplified.)

The number of pads is given by abc. When a=b=c, it's x^3. \
Each set of pads in 2D could be connected in straight lines. \
When it is in a 3D lattice, there are more straight lines interconnecting the layers.

There are as many interconnect lines as there are pads, multiplied by the dimensions. \
A small but not insignificant optimisation to the number of interconnects can be made. \
The interconnects across the edge of each plane can be removed from the total. \
This only highlights the interconnects which are on the inside of the lattice.

The way that AntiMaths is applied to this problem allows for a standard formula to be written \
that makes use of what would otherwise be invalid dimensions in the negative space. \
Certain aspects of the calculation are considered edge-case and not suitable for general maths.

Here is another example which makes use of AntiMathematic calculations. \
In this pcb there are vias as the interconnects between each set of 2.54mm pitch space pads. \
The pitch space of the via relative to the pad is 1.27mm. There is an extra set of vias on the edge.

The vias on the edge can be either removed from that edge or added to the opposite edge. \
The number of vias is different from the number of interconnects because vias overlap at corners. \
The calculation might need n-1 vias removing from the total or n-1 adding to the total \
depending on the context in which you decide to count and what it is you are counting.
