# ASUS RoG Q-Code Replicator
```diff
Most ASUS and Republic of Gamers Motherboards have a small dual 7-segment display or 2 to display BIOS Boot Codes.
These are used to diagnose any problems a self-built PC may have if it fails to start up correctly.

- [WARNING]: USING A MACROPAD WITH Q-CODE LOGGER IN ITS CURRENT STATE MAY CAUSE DATA LOSS TO YOUR MACROPAD'S CIRCUITPY DRIVE!

Alternatives include a special USB Port (such as Q-Code Logger) for presenting this information to an unbricked device
or a Pi Zero Gadget with HyperPixel4 Display over USB showing this information across its single USB cable with multiple protocols
or even a traditional ISA/PCIe/LPC POST Card connected to a Pi to broadcast live remote Q-Code displays to a Mobile App
including a custom feature to display your own Q-Codes after boot has completed
