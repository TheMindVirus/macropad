[Unified Field Theory]
null - <null field> null capacitor (stores nothing, void, antimatter)

magnetic - <tesla field> flux capacitor (cores and solenoids, polar difference)

electric - <volta field> electrolytic capacitor (dipoles and dielectric, potential difference)
electromagnetic... -> optic -> optical capacitor (crystal oscillator)

gravitic - <higgs field> gravitic capacitor (gravitational potential reservoirs, neutrino difference)
electrogravitic... -> kinetic -> kinetic capacitor (dynamo, turbo)
magnetogravitic... -> suspension -> suspension capacitor (rod, maglev)
electromagnetogravitic... -> thermal -> thermal capacitor (heat plate, boiler)

entropic - <sienar field> entropic capacitor (chemical mass spectrometry, ionic difference) <-- forms plasmas involving a circuit made of invisible electrons and visible positron beams with muon-asteroid-rings and a neutral medium
electroentropic - orbital field - orbital capacitor (usually made of ceramic, bidirectional improvement) <-- they're making these out of glass and turning them into antennas now
magnetoentropic - adhesion field - adhesion capacitor (suction cup 's just a ball of neutrons...a bit sticky...like glue...) <-- found in the cores of several planets, stars and celestial bodies, also called muon-asteroid-clusters
gravitoentropic - cohesion field - cohesion capacitor (this is the stuff that turns water into gelatine, it's quite tense) <-- meta-google will like this one, neuroplastic cores to put in their mobile edge servers
electromagnetoentropic - seismic field - seismic capacitor (most neutrino side effect x-ray synchrotron experiments) <-- might cause natural disasters on the other side of the planet if they're not careful with this stuff
magnetogravitoentropic - quake field - quake capacitor (ancient japanese seismic earthquake studies, spongy structures to hold buildings integral) <-- also used in a case of medical emergency to quickly fill in perforated organs
electrogravitoentropic - pressure field - pressure capacitor (gas canisters for anaesthetists) <pascal's field> <-- used to keep ship fuel contained before it's required by the ion engines, also by torniquets to measure pulse
electromagnetogravitoentropic - radio field - radio capacitor (radioactive substance rocks) <curie's field> <-- highly dangerous, should be disposed of with care and lasers
